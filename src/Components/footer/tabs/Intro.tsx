        This conversion tool simplifies the process of transitioning your code
        from vJass to Lua. To use it, paste your vJass code into the input
        field, and the tool will automatically transcompile it. If the "Copy on
        Convert" option is enabled, the converted Lua code will be directly
        copied to your clipboard, streamlining the workflow.
